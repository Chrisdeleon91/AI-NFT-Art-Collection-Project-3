### Authors: Christopher De Leon, Mike West, Daniyar Mussin

### Introduction

* **System Design & Architecture**: To be led by Christopher, outlining the main components of the NFT marketplace system and how they will interact.

* **Art Development**:  Daniyar will design the NFT's using ChatGPT's API function to create collections of art using prompt engineering.

* **Interface Design**: Mike will take the helm in designing a sleek, intuitive, and interactive interface using Plotty Express, ensuring the system is user-friendly and efficient.

* **Integration & Testing**: The team will collaborate in this final phase to integrate all system components to ensure full functionality.
  
### Research Questions
**Our research questions are as follows**:
* Can we build a local NFT marketplace from what we learned in class?
* How can we enhance the functionality and visual aesthetic over using Streamlit?
* Can we implement Chat GPT's generative image AI into creating an art collection for us?

### Libraries and tools used
We will use the following in our project:
* Remix IDE (to launch smart contract)
* React (Javascript)
* Hardhat (to connect to network)
* Alchemy
* OpenAI library (ChatGPT)
* Flask
* Pi√±ata (to upload your data to IPFS)
* Metamask
* Ganache

### Overview of Tasks
* Generating Images
* Integrating 
* Visualization
* Integration
